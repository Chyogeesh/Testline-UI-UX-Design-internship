# Testline-UI-UX-Design-internship
It is a internship assignment
To design a mascot for the Testline logo and integrate it into an app screen, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Design the Mascot
The mascot should:

Represent the brand: Capture the Testline ethos (education, students, positivity, support).
Be student-friendly: Use bright colors, friendly features, and an engaging expression (similar to Duolingo’s owl).
Adapt to app environments: Keep the design simple enough to scale or animate on different screen sizes.
Here’s an example mascot concept:

Name: Tessa (or Testy)
Look: A friendly, anthropomorphic pencil with glasses, a graduation cap, and cheerful eyes.
Style: Cartoon-like with rounded shapes to make it approachable.
Personality: Supportive and knowledgeable, providing tips and encouragement.
2. Design the App Screen
Here’s how to incorporate the mascot into an app screen:

Homepage/Welcome Screen:
The mascot welcomes students with a speech bubble or animation like "Welcome back! Let’s ace your next test!"
Place the mascot in the corner to not overpower the UI.
Notification Screen:
Show the mascot holding a notification banner with motivational quotes like "Keep up the great work!" or reminders like "Your quiz starts in 10 minutes!"
3. Tools for Designing
Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop: For mascot illustration.
Figma/Adobe XD: For designing the app screen.
Canva: For quick prototyping (optional).
