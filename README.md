# Testline-UI-UX-Design-internship
It is a internship assignment
To design a mascot for the Testline logo and integrate it into an app screen, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Design the Mascot
The mascot should:

Represent the brand: Capture the Testline ethos (education, students, positivity, support).
Be student-friendly: Use bright colors, friendly features, and an engaging expression (similar to Duolingo’s owl).
Adapt to app environments: Keep the design simple enough to scale or animate on different screen sizes.
Here’s an example mascot concept:

Name: Tessa (or Testy)
Look: A friendly, anthropomorphic pencil with glasses, a graduation cap, and cheerful eyes.
Style: Cartoon-like with rounded shapes to make it approachable.
Personality: Supportive and knowledgeable, providing tips and encouragement.
2. Design the App Screen
Here’s how to incorporate the mascot into an app screen:

Homepage/Welcome Screen:
The mascot welcomes students with a speech bubble or animation like "Welcome back! Let’s ace your next test!"
Place the mascot in the corner to not overpower the UI.
Notification Screen:
Show the mascot holding a notification banner with motivational quotes like "Keep up the great work!" or reminders like "Your quiz starts in 10 minutes!"
3. Tools for Designing
Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop: For mascot illustration.
Figma/Adobe XD: For designing the app screen.
Steps to Submit the Assignment
Create the mascot using a design tool (e.g., Illustrator, Photoshop, or Figma). Export it as a .png file.
Design the app screen layout, integrating the mascot into the user interface.
Code the app screen (use frameworks like Flutter or React Native).
Share your prototype and code repository (e.g., GitHub link) with the Testline team.
Output Description
Once the app screen is launched, users will see:

A vibrant mascot greeting them with motivational messages.
A clean, interactive UI that aligns with the app's educational theme.
The mascot adding a personal, supportive touch to enhance user engagement.
